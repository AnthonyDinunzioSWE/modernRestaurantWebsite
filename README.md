Key Features
------------

This project contains several key features that demonstrate my ability to build modern and user-friendly web applications:

-   **Responsive Design**: The website adjusts seamlessly to both mobile and desktop screens, ensuring that all users have a great experience.
-   **Mobile-First Navigation**: The navigation menu on mobile is hidden by default and can be toggled with a hamburger icon. It includes smooth animations for opening and closing the menu.
-   **Hero Section**: The landing page greets users with a vibrant hero section, highlighting the restaurant's branding and offering quick action buttons (like "Reserve Now" and "View Menu").
-   **About Us Section**: A brief description of the restaurant's history, vision, and team.
-   **Menu Section**: A dynamic display of food items with images, descriptions, and prices.
-   **Contact Form**: An easy-to-use contact form where users can inquire or make reservations.

Challenges Overcome
-------------------

While building FauxFood, I encountered a few challenges that helped me grow as a developer:

-   **Mobile Menu Transitions**: Ensuring smooth transitions when toggling the mobile menu was tricky, especially when it had to slide in and out of view while keeping the background dimmed.
-   **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring the website looked consistent across different browsers, especially with flexbox and TailwindCSS utilities.
-   **Dynamic Content**: Ensuring that the content, especially images and menu items, displayed correctly on all screen sizes and didn't break under various conditions.
